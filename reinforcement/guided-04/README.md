# 01. RouteIQ / lucasrouter: worked examples and learning journals

A dispatch interface lets a dispatcher inspect routes and a driver report stop outcomes. Explain how a user action becomes stored state, how list views are derived, and what an undo operation actually restores.

This fourth block complements the [original foundations](../README.md), [second practice block](../expansion-02/README.md), and [interview library](../interview-03/README.md). It adds slower, solved explanations and several ways to work through the same mechanism. Earlier files and unfinished exercises are preserved.

## Choose how to begin today

- **Read a complete example:** choose a slow explanation below. It starts with a concrete fixture and derives the expected result.
- **Follow a narrated thought process:** use a worked journal. These are explicitly fictional teaching narratives, not records of your work or new production incidents.
- **See the relationships:** use the workshop diagrams and model trace tables. Label references, requests, and state ownership separately.
- **Run and inspect:** start with [the runnable worked notebook](WORKED-NOTEBOOK.md), which checks three concrete examples against the existing teaching reference.
- **Speak and reflect:** follow a workshop's teach-back route and use [your own journal template](MY-JOURNAL.md).

These are complementary activities, not fixed categories of people. Switch formats when it helps you notice a missing assumption. The [learning pathways](PATHWAYS.md) and [review plan](REVIEW-PLAN.md) offer bounded sessions so this library does not become a requirement to read everything in sequence.

## Six project cases, three complementary treatments

| Case | Situation | Explanation | Narrative | Activity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A list changes underneath a selection | [Read slowly](explanations/01.md) | [Worked journal](journals/01.md) | [Draw / build / speak](workshops/01.md) |
| 2 | Two records share a nested address | [Read slowly](explanations/02.md) | [Worked journal](journals/02.md) | [Draw / build / speak](workshops/02.md) |
| 3 | Undo arrives after newer work | [Read slowly](explanations/03.md) | [Worked journal](journals/03.md) | [Draw / build / speak](workshops/03.md) |
| 4 | Proof and status disagree | [Read slowly](explanations/04.md) | [Worked journal](journals/04.md) | [Draw / build / speak](workshops/04.md) |
| 5 | Keyboard focus loses its owner | [Read slowly](explanations/05.md) | [Worked journal](journals/05.md) | [Draw / build / speak](workshops/05.md) |
| 6 | A restored draft has yesterday’s shape | [Read slowly](explanations/06.md) | [Worked journal](journals/06.md) | [Draw / build / speak](workshops/06.md) |

The situations extend the earlier interview scenarios. Their new treatments are solved reasoning, reflection, and transfer practice rather than another set of unanswered interview prompts. A scenario can describe a synthetic failure without asserting that the current application contains that defect.

## Twenty-six transferable worked models

These model chapters are intentionally available in each project pack for a self-contained reading route. Their technical core is shared across projects; the source connection and local case references adapt the learning context. Do not count them as 260 different algorithms.

## Source map and evidence boundaries

- [src/lib/types.ts](<../../src/lib/types.ts>)
- [src/store/useAppStore.ts](<../../src/store/useAppStore.ts>)
- [src/components/dispatch/DispatchOverview.tsx](<../../src/components/dispatch/DispatchOverview.tsx>)
- [src/components/dispatch/DispatchScreen.tsx](<../../src/components/dispatch/DispatchScreen.tsx>)
- [learn/00-onramp.md](<../../learn/00-onramp.md>)
- [training/ladder/J2-component-test-foundation.md](<../../training/ladder/J2-component-test-foundation.md>)

The actual boundary to investigate is the store action and its persistence boundary. Current source determines what the app does; a teaching model may introduce a simplified field, policy, or serialized execution order. Keep source reading, model execution, and application verification distinct. Human mastery remains unassessed until the learner produces their own explanation and evidence.
