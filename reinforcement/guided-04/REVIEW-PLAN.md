# Review through reconstruction: RouteIQ / lucasrouter

This plan uses the new material in short sessions while preserving the earlier interview route. It does not assume one preferred format is sufficient for every task. Each session ends with a concrete artifact and a stated evidence limit.

## Week one: build a clear mental model

**Day 1 — one slow case.** Read the setup, predict the outcome, and then read the explanation. Write one sentence naming the invariant and one naming the tempting shortcut. Find the first step where the shortcut fails. Keep the initial prediction.

**Day 2 — a trace without notes.** Reconstruct yesterday's fixture and state table from memory. Compare it with the worked version. Correct the earliest mistaken step rather than replacing the whole table. Draw the relevant owners and label the arrows.

**Day 3 — the runnable notebook.** Predict its three results, run the checks, and explain the difference between checking a reference and solving your own earlier exercise. Add a new fixture in personal practice work and write its expected result before execution.

**Day 4 — another representation.** Explain one case aloud or to a partner. Avoid library names for the first thirty seconds; describe the user consequence and values involved. Then introduce the implementation detail that enforces the rule.

**Day 5 — a source comparison.** Follow the store action and its persistence boundary. Identify one guarantee the actual code supports and one assumption that belongs only to the teaching model. If the behavior already exists, record a characterization opportunity rather than proposing an unnecessary rewrite.

**Day 6 — a changed assumption.** Add a second entity, reordered event, missing field, different scope, or late failure as appropriate. Predict what changes and what remains invariant. Name the test layer that could establish the result.

**Day 7 — an honest journal entry.** Use the template to describe your own learning. Separate what you observed from what you inferred. Choose one remaining question for the following week instead of trying to summarize every file you read.

## Week two: transfer and explain

Choose two additional local cases and three related worked models. Alternate a reading session with a reconstruction session. Use the earlier interview prompts only after you can explain the mechanism without their answer notes. The interview timebox then tests communication and prioritization rather than whether you happened to memorize a phrase.

At the end of the week, explain one case in two lengths: ninety seconds for the user consequence and key decision, and five minutes for the trace, counterexample, and evidence boundary. Both versions should preserve the same facts. A longer explanation should add causal detail, not inflate the claim.

## Three checks of transfer

1. **Changed fixture:** can you predict a new result without reading the answer?
2. **Changed representation:** can you move between prose, table, diagram, and code without losing the identity or ordering rule?
3. **Changed project:** can you name which assumption carries over and which does not?

A successful transfer is not necessarily identical code. A local draft and a durable command can share an ownership principle while needing very different implementation boundaries. State those differences explicitly.

## Record progress without pretending to measure everything

Use not attempted, studied, explained, independently modeled, and application-verified as descriptive statuses. Attach evidence when you use the last two. These labels describe work performed, not permanent ability or interview readiness. Author verification of the reference examples does not fill your progress record.

If you repeatedly miss one distinction, narrow the next exercise. For identity errors, use two records and a reorder. For timing errors, use two controlled completions. For contract errors, compare omitted, null, zero, and wrong-type inputs. For proof errors, ask which boundary your current check cannot observe.
